  <h2>Post links. Find them later.</h2>

  <p>Hipchat is awesome.  Sorting through Hipchat's history logs is not.  To solve this, Hiplink pulls in links from Hipchat messages and saves them to autogenerated folders created by the <span style="color:#fff;">'_folderName'</span> posted before the link url in the Hipchat message.</p>


<h2>Mandatory: Folder Name & Link Url</h2>
<span style="font-size:1.3em; line-height:2em; background-color:#fff; padding:10px;">_events www.sfoutsidelands.com</span>

<h2>Optional: Hashtags</h2>
<span style="font-size:1.3em; line-height:2em; background-color:#fff; padding:10px;">_events www.sfoutsidelands.com #san_francisco #concerts</span>

<p>* In this example, Hiplink generates a Folder called 'events' and saves the link to Outside Lands inside it.  If the user posts hashtags after the url, they can filter their links in Hiplink to find the ones with the hashtag of 'san_francisco' or 'concerts'.</p>
